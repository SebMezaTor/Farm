    To-Do List:
    This is a comment I wrote on October 23rd make sure to fix the placeholders of the fruits, fruits for sale, vegetables, and vegetables for sale headings as they are incorrect. Also, find out how to import fonts to the correct one.

    Fix the nav, its not where it needs to be. Find out how to also make the footer look like the example.
